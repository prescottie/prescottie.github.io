        <h3 class="section-heading">Summary</h3>
        <p class="offset-col-4">As a Full Stack Web Developer, I am all about the big picture! No front-end is effective without a robust well-written back-end and no back-end is effective without an intuitive, responsive front-end. Marrying these two things, creates beautiful code that usually results in a fantastic product that people love. I always strive to write well tested, readable and modular code. My diverse experience as a property manger, owning a small landscaping business and hospitality have given me an excellent intuition in understanding and anticipating a client's needs, which is crucial in delivering products that client's find valuable. My primary focus for the next 3 years is  personal development and growth as a developer. I need a team that looks for opportunities to challenge me and encourage me to be produce the best results I can. If they also were interested in brewing craft beer, video games, and skiing that wouldn't suck either. </p>
